# Introduction

Ensuring secure and dependable communication between software agents is vital for building a trustworthy Internet of Agents (IoA). Much like humans use official documents, such as driver licenses to authenticate themselves in real-world interactions, software agents require reliable and verifiable credentials to confirm their identity and build trust with other agents and humans. Without effective authentication, unverified or malicious agents could disrupt any Multi-Agent System (MAS) or network of agents, potentially causing misinformation, fraud, or security vulnerabilities. Thus, a consistent and standardized approach for authenticating agents and validating their metadata is critical for fostering secure and reliable interactions across an IoA. These authentication and validation requirements also apply to Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers and MAS, since these are positioned as building blocks, and aggregation elements, in an IoA, respectively.

## Identity Requirements

The [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) enables the assignment of identities to Agents, MCP Servers, and MAS in a way that is:

- **Open:** No central authority is in charge of assigning IDs.
- **Collision-free:** Each Agent, MCP Server, and MAS has a universally unique identifier.
- **Verifiable:** Each Agent, MCP Server, and MAS is associated to a Verifiable Credential (VC) that can be used to authenticate its ID and provenance.

## Supporting both Conventions and Standards for ID assignment

The [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) prescribes neither the use of a specific identity assignment technique nor the use of a specific identity format. Instead, the [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) enables the use and amalgamation of various (heterogeneous) identity types, while ensuring a common or standard way to:

- Present identifiers
- Verify identifiers

irrespective of their identity type. To this end, the [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) supports the use of conventions as well as the use of standards to openly assign an identity to an Agent, an MCP Server, or a MAS.

### Conventions

As a starting point, the [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) supports two types of conventions for identity assignment:

1. The use of `User Accounts` and/or `Service Accounts` provided by an Identity Provider (IdP). Identities provided through Okta, Microsoft AD, Entra ID, Duo, Ping Identity, Auth0, or Google ID can be used in the context of [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) to assign universally unique identifiers to Agents, MCP Servers, and MASs in a open way.

2. The use of `well-known identifiers`, e.g., following the convention proposed by Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This convention enables both open identity assignment as well as the use of universally unique identifiers for Agent Cards, which capture the metadata and characteristics that define, allow to discover, and identify an Agent within the A2A ecosystem. More specifically, in the A2A protocol, the Agent Card standardizes the format of the data shared during discovery, which may be facilitated by hosting the Agent Card at a well-known path or identifier, such as: https://YOUR-DOMAIN/.well-known/agent.json. In this case, the Agent Card includes details such as the Agent's capabilities, authentication requirements, and endpoint information.

### Standards

Similarly, as a starting point, the [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) supports one standard for identity assignment:

1. The use of W3C [`Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/). The W3C standards have done ground work in the context of decentralized identifiers, decentralized credential management, and the capacity to generate, authenticate, and selectively disclose [`Verifiable Credentials (VCs)`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/). This approach allows organizations to assign universally unique identifiers to their Agents, MCP Servers, and MASs in a open and decentralized manner. Moreover, the identities can be stored in decentralized networks along with a set of associated VCs, which can be utilized to cryptographically verify the provenance of the Agents, MCP Servers, and MASs, their versions, their skills and other attributes and features, thereby facilitating secure multi-factor authentication (MFA) and authorization processes across these entities as well as between them and humans.

:::tip[IMPORTANT]
Independently of whether the identity is assigned following a convention or a standardized framework, at this stage the main focus of the [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) is to provide a common and trustworthy mechanism to **present identifiers** and to **verify them**. More specifically, the [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) not only supports various (and heterogeneous) identifiers that are universally unique but also proposes a standard way of presenting and verifying such identifiers, thereby enabling freedom in the selection of interoperable identities in an IoA.
